Working and Solutions of Eloquent JS

I'm trying to get my way through Eloquent Javascript book, by Marijn Haverbeke. It's an excellent book, if you haven't had a chance to read it, you should. See it here: [Eloquent JS](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)

I will be trying to update this repo as much as I can over the next few weeks (and months) as I go over the book.

The goal is to be a Javascript Ninja by the end of the year (Hiii yaaaa!)
